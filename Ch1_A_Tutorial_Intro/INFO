Hello, world

Choosing the C compiller version: 
* $ gcc -std=c89
* $ gcc -std=c99
* $ gcc -std=c11

A C program consists of functions and variables.
	A function contains statements.
	Variables store values.
	
Primitives data types in C:
* char
* short
* int
* long
* float
* double

Assignment statement: lower = 12;
The body of a while can be one or multiple statements.
Pick a style that suits you, then use it consistently.
There is no IN/OUT builtin C. Use stdio library for this.

%d		printf as decimal integer
%6d		print as decimal integer, at least 6 characters wide
%f			print as floating point
%6f		print as floating point, at least 6 characters wide
%.2f		print as floating point, 2 characters after decimal point
%6.2f		print as floating point, at least 6 wide and 2 after decimal p
%o		octal
%x			hexadecimal
%c			character
%s			string
%%		to print %

Bad practice to bury "magic numbers"!
Call by value or by reference.
Call by value is an asset, however, not a liability.
'\0' → the null character in a string array. This char marks the end of the string array.
Local variables are called automatic variables.
Definition → refers to the place where the variable is created or assigned storage.
Declaration → refers to places where the nature of the variable is stated but no storage is allocated.
